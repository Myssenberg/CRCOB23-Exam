"""Elliptic curve proof of knowledge

This file contains an elliptic curve implementation of
the proof of knowledge described on page 1, first example,
in Ivan Damg√•rd's paper "On Sigma-Protocols".

This file consists of functions that together can be used to run
a full proof of knowledge.

This file requires that the environment you are running on have the "petlib"
library installed.

The file contains the following functions:
    - groupGen: returns the EC group, group order, and group generator
    - keyGen: returns the key pair consisting of secret and public key
    - Prover_commitment: returns the commitment and prover randomness
    - Verifier_challenge: returns the challenge
    - Prover_response: returns the response
    - proofGen: returns the generated proof consisting of
                commitment, challenge, response
    - verify: returns True or False depending on whether the
              proof was accepted

At the end of the file some examples of how to run a full proof of knowledge
as well as how the time taking is done for the analysis of the project.
These are commented out, but are kept in the file for documentation purposes.
